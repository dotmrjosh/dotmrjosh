# where i'm at

recently i was back in hospital for attempted suicide. after being discharged, i was let go from my job. i see the people i love struggling just as much and it's never made me feel more useless.

# finding hope

by no means have the problems have gotten easier, or that i don't still get down sometimes. but i'm making it to the next day. i'm building and creating things i'm proud of. i'm enjoying time with people i love and i'm finding good in the world through all the noise.

i've learnt to better reach out to friends when i need it and grown closer because of it. gained confidence in my ability to create, communicate, and recognise issues before they become real problems.

(big shout out to st vinnies and the PEC team for the amazing care they gave to me during my time there.)

so this is a reflection of my experience. not to complain about what's happened, but to [keep moving forward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmW3H-EXYS0), and maybe help you too if you're experiencing something similar.

# being professional

since i'm now out of a job, i'm back looking at the job market and the discourse around it. there's a lot of chatter ranging from work ethic, economics, business goals, and everything in-between.

here in australia (and a lot of the world) the economy doesn't feel to great. minimum wage doesn't mean what it used to and more and more it feels out of our control (so i won't comment to much on the topic). but what is in control is how we treat each other in the workplace.

i've always believed professional to mean you maintain respect no matter the choices, opinions, or differences you may have with someone. working professionally means 2 people can both achieve something (be it building a business or putting food on the table) without causing harm to one another.

it's a loose definition but at it's core i would use "be respectful" and "be professional" interchangeably and something i try to do good by.

i feel workplaces are missing the mark. there's so much push to be the next big thing and shadow what came before us, regardless of the consequences. there's more push for breaking records and achieving numbers that just don't live in reality anymore.

i feel we should be looking at our immediate communities. our charities and local small businesses. places that could feel a positive impact if we chose to support.

the people in your community will grow you. it will mean so much more coming from people that have felt an impact because of your good, rather than a like from someone that's doom scrolling and chuckled at your sexist joke.

we're pushing harder and harder, and the consequences are becoming peoples lives and their safety. not only are the consequences worse, but the value of taking those risks are worse. there is no reward, only the idea of one. cold manipulation and deceit purely for the sake of making a number bigger.

i understand a business needs to operate and there are costs, and i respect needing to make a choice to further business. but not at any harm to your employees or peers in the industry. the IT industry has long been stereotyped for discrimination on a mass scale. starting with us, i'd like to see that change.

if you have to work at these companies because it puts food on the table, know that you are not the problem and you have all my support. you should not have to jeopardise your livelihood to feel safe. so know there is always someone who will root for you. who will have your back. and be kind when you need it most.

you're not alone;

# being kind

reasons to be angry or upset are everywhere. you can't go online without an algorithm trying to rage bait you into interacting.

but there are some amazing things in the noise. a cool thing i saw was learning that [whales could have a solution to DNA repair](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11580846/) which could reduce cancer. i'm letting my nerd side show but i'm sharing it because i think it's fun and cool.

i think algorithms incentivise people to start as many arguments as possible. there are people who i disagree with but have the utmost respect for and would love to have discussions with, and have seen spectacular debates. but the respect of these discussions has been taken advantage of for publicity.

going into 2026 all i ask is here and there, show a bit of kindness. and if you can't, always show respect. because without it we are no better than our past.
